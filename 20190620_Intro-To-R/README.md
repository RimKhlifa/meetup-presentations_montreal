## Computing requirements

If you can, bring your own laptop. Laptops should have the following installed:

- R (>= 3.6.0)
- RStudio (>= 1.2)

If you have older versions of R/RStudio installed, it is recommended that you
install the latest versions if possible. Instructions for installing all these
software is given below.

In addition, please install/update the following R packages available on CRAN:

- `rmarkdown`
- `tidyverse`
- `skimr`
- `rio`

CRAN packages can be installed from the Packages tab in RStudio:

### RStudio Cloud

If you want you can join the workspace on RStudio cloud by clicking [here](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/19774/join?access_code=eSVB%2B8WMSwYPBdoK2d5k5CpwO5jpm4oabWjprWfJ).

## Installing R

Download the pre-compiled binary for your OS from https://cloud.r-project.org/
    and install. More specifically:

**For Windows**

Click "Download R for Windows", then "base", then "Download R 3.6.0 for Windows". This will download an `.exe` file; once downloaded, open to start the installation. If you do not have administrator rights, the installer will default to install in your Documents folder - if you prefer, you can change the location to another folder that you have write access to.

**For Mac**

Click "Download R for (Mac) OS X", then "R-3.6.0.pkg" to download the installer. Run the installer to complete installation.

**For Linux**

Click "Download R for Linux". Instructions on installing are given for Debian, Redhat, Suse and Ubuntu distributions. Where there is a choice, install both `r-base` and `r-base-dev`.

## Installing R Studio

Downloads are available from <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download> (scroll to the end of the page to see the downloads).

**For Windows with no admin rights**

Download the `.zip` source archive under "Zip/Tarballs". Extract the files to a folder where you have write access, e.g. `C:\Users\username\RStudio`. In this folder, open the `bin` directory and find the RStudio program: it is named `rstudio.exe`, but the file extension will typically be hidden, so look for `rstudio`. Right-click this executable to create a desktop shortcut. Double-click the executable or use the shortcut to open.

**For all other operating systems**

Download the relevant installer for your OS listed under "Installers for Supported Platforms". Run the installer to complete installation.

## Issues

If you have problems setting up your laptop I will try to help at the start of the meetup - arrive early if you can! If we cannot get you set up, you will be able to use RStudio Cloud <https://rstudio.cloud/> join the project by clicking [here](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/19774/join?access_code=eSVB%2B8WMSwYPBdoK2d5k5CpwO5jpm4oabWjprWfJ).
